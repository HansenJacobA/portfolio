# About

"From the imagination to reality."

Hello, my name is Jacob Hansen and I am a published photographer, United States Army Veteran, and a Software Engineer. I have a passion for transferring intangible ideas into physical reality.

Beginning with photography for example, I would imagine the types of photos I would want to capture in various settings, such as taking an image of the Milky Way behind a rocky mountain top, then try different methods to make it happen. In this example I would travel around in Google Maps to find a nearby rocky mountain, find the date that the Milky Way would be aligned with the mountain using Photopills, then try to take the image with researched camera settings. After succeeding, I found this to be a never ending and satisfying cycle applicable to not only photography, but software engineering as well.

In life, I have wanted the liberty of not confining myself to applications others have built, but to also create and use my own that would be helpful to me personally. With software engineering, from idea to the physical, I have been able to create my own, as well as others', applications now that are used on any device type, mobile through desktop, that are entirely custom.

From what started out as personal curiosity, I have found an ever continuos passion for transferring ideas into the physical world. If there has ever been an idea for something that you wanted available to you, specifically software, let's turn your idea into reality together.

## Current Status

In light of ChatGPT, I am currently discovering more about AI and how to make use of it personally and for others.
